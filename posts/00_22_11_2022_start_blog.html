# The best blogging platform

I wanted to start a blog. For the longest time possible. After trying most of them i just built a static index.html with markdown parser for the posts, and hosted it on GitHub pages. Here is why.

I like blogging. I find it interesting since i discovered blogging back in high school and after reading a few articles on blogging i thought i knew what is the best blogging platform. Well not so much, i remember it being undecided on WordPress, blogger and Weebly. So i made one blog on each. The thing is they were easy to set up but limiting designs and if you wanted to customize the theme you needed to pay for it. Instead I spent a lot of time looking for themes which of course it was disappointing at the end because I could not find the right one. At the end I deleted all three.

Then i went professional blogger for like 6 months and made medium and WordPress blog. Which I deleted as well. What I didn't like about medium. A lot of people become blogging influencers and spend all their time pumping up content. And it felt like I am chasing to read everything they post which is hard because you can't spend your entire life reading blog posts. The FOMO was all time high. But when you look back you realize you were not missing anything and you just spent time consuming content which could have been spent reading books or just working. You are not going to built work ethic like Elon Musk by reading blog posts on how to build work ethic like Elon Musk instead try working for a change.

Then, I was influenced by web developers and they were all rocking the current thing. Or at the time it was Gatsby. I procrastinated on it and I am glad I did. As it turns out Gatsby way easy to set up, but maintaining the blog was pain in the ass. And many people will brag about how awesome tech stack their blogs were but then completely abandon their blogs. With few posts or less. (Most of them were straight empty.)

Lifecycle of Gatsbyjs blog:

In mean time I realized how practical was Paul Graham's blog. The essays part was just list of links and the other part was just simple text. And what do you need more it's the important on point. He have written some classics worth rereading like 100 times. Then i saw what levels did which was similar but also included some screenshots as well. It inspired me to make something similar.

GitHub Pages and Jekyll plus a beautiful minimalist theme for Jekyll. Immediately I saw the potential of GitHub pages for hosting a blog and portfolio. The problem was the set up. I had to deal with bundlers which I think is the unnecessary part of the blogging journey. I could use template but then I had to admit I could not figure out the bundlers. The ego was not letting me have it easy. But after struggling with bundlers I decided for fun to recreate the home page of the theme I have chosen. It was so easy and fast without setups that are hard to maintain. The home page of this blog is just 50 html lines and few CSS. It was easier to write it from scratch then to set it up. 

But then how do I write posts I don't want to write the blog post inside p tag. I solved this by using [markdown parser](https://github.com/oscarmorrison/md-page) that i include on top of my post page. So right now I am inside Sublime text editor editing markdown which is very easy and I can just post to my blog with commit. The beauty in this is this post is going to sit down as draft on my laptop as long as it needs to be and when it's ready I will just push it to the repository of my blog.

Basically the entire post page is just markdown parsed to look good. I can abandon my blog for a year and when I come back i can just continue where I stopped. I will not waste time on updating anything because there is nothing to update. It just works. I think in a way I hacked blogging. This is the way.
